# Loan-case-prediction
A Machine Learning model is trained to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.
In this project, the dataset is trained by using four classification algorithms. They are:
-KNN
-Decision Tree
-Support Vector Machine
-Logistic Regression
In Evaluation, three similarity scores (Jaccard similarity score, f1 score, logloss score) are caluclated for each algorithm and choosen the best one.
